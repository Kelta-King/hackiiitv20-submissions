<h2>Future Scaope (What features we can add to advance it)</h2>
- Recommender system to recommend new users to add them as friends based on features like illness, location (decreasing priority) by using Data mining concepts.<br>
- For validation of the patients, the registered user will be required to upload a certificate or medical prescription from registered hospital certifying his illness<br>
- Notify / call friends in times of emergency<br>
- In the profile, his history can be recorded using the hospital data<br>
- Can virtually talk with each other by Video conferencing.<br>
<br>
